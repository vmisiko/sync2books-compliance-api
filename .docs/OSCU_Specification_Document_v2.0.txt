1. OSCU service

1.1. Introduction

ISO 9001:2015 CERTIFIED

Online Sales Control Unit (OSCU) is a communication module for private Trader Invoicing System (TIS)
applications to send/receive various data to and from the KRA eTIMS API server. OSCU includes SKMM
that manages encryption and signature data, internal data, and keys.

1.2. Environment

OSCU has two types; Production and Test.

Type

Production OSCU

Test OSCU

Description
Server TIS application utilizes a Production OSCU to send and receive data to
and from the KRA eTIMS API production server.
During development, the test application can send and receive test data to and
from the KRA eTIMS API test server using a Test OSCU.

2. Technical Outline

ISO 9001:2015 CERTIFIED

2.1 The Application Process to Use OSCU

To use OSCU, a taxpayer must apply for OSCU service and get approval from KRA.

After the approval of OSCU, a taxpayer can install OSCU in a server and start activation. When a taxpayer
calls the initialization Method of OSCU with PIN, branch office, and equipment information, OSCU will begin
verification of the device and receive communication key from the KRA eTIMS API server.

2.2 OSCU Running Process and Main Configurations

There are several technical policies that OSCU users have to follow.

1. To use OSCU Library, Internet is always needed as OSCU Library will be communicating to KRA

eTIMS API.

2. Sending/Receiving data to and from eTIMS API Server will be done by calling Methods of OSCU

Java library.

3. To retrieve the latest data from eTIMS API server, OSCU shall send the ‘Date and Time’ on which the
kind of data was finally received from the eTIMS API server. So, the ‘Date and Time’ of final request
should be managed by TIS, and once successfully retrieved, TIS shall update the latest ‘Date and
Time’ to the related data for the next update.

Note: For non Java application, you can directly connect to eTIMS API server without passing through
OSCU Library.

2.3 A Sample of OSCU Guide Document

Below is a sample Java code to show how developers can use OSCU library

The figure above shows the flow of data exchanged between eTIMS API server and TIS application using
OSCU.

3 OSCU Business Process

3.1 OSCU Functions

ISO 9001:2015 CERTIFIED

The Java Methods used in this OSCU are grouped by its purpose into eight (8) categories. The below briefly
introduces the purpose of each category.
1. Data initialization (Send only)

a. For a device authentication (OSCU), registration and approval of equipment must be

completed.
2. Code data (Get only)

a. Methods of this category are used to receive necessary standard codes and data from the
eTIMS API Server, which is the basis of generating invoice data. To send Invoice data to the
eTIMS API server, the consistency of the data is essential.

b. The standard codes and data are including; item classification code for managing item,
location code, and package, weight code, PIN list and notice from KRA. For more
information, check code definition chapter.

3. Branch information (Get and Send)

accounts of branch offices.

a. Some methods of this category are to send customer list of head and branch offices and user

4.

5.

b. This category has a method which requests branch codes to be used later while sending stock

from main branch to branch offices.

Item information (Get and Send)

a. Methods of this category are to send registered item and item composition information in a

TIS application.
In case you want to recover your items, you can receive them through eTIMS API server.

b.

Imported item (Get and Send)

a. Methods of this category are to receive data of imported items which is declared by the PIN

of TIS application owner and to send confirmation of the received imported items.

b. The imported items data are retrieved from KRA customs system and data can be used for

stock adjustment.

6. Sales management (Send only)

Server.

a. Methods of this category are to send data of sales transaction and sales Invoice to eTIMS

b. Sales transaction data is composed of sales contract such as Customer PIN, Customer Name,
Sales Type Code, Receipt Type Code, Payment Type Code, Invoice Status Code, Validated
Date, Sale Date, Stock Released Date, Cancel Requested Date, Canceled Date Refunded Date
and etc.

c. Sales Invoice data is composed of Invoice information such as Invoice Number, Current
Receipt Number, Total Receipt Number, Customer PIN, Customer Mobile Number, Receipt
Published Date, Internal Data, Receipt Signature and etc.

7. Purchase information (Get and Send)

a. Methods of this category are to request data of purchase transaction of the PIN of TIS

application owner to eTIMS Server and send confirmation of the transaction.

b. When a seller registers sales transaction and Invoice data to eTIMS Server, buyer can

request such data for purchase confirmation and stock adjustment purpose.

8. Stock information (Get and Send)

application to eTIMS Server.

a. Methods of this category are to send inventory in and out and stock status by item of TIS

b. Methods of this category also request stock from main branch
